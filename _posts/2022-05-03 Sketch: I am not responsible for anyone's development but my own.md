A book called ‘Stretch: How to future-proof yourself for tomorrow’s workplace’, it shows how to prepare for an unknown future, be fully engaged, and stretch to the next level to avoid becoming obsolete at work, especially for now de-globalization would be a sub-trend in the world during the endemic or post pandemic ages.

Accept uncertainty 

A story in this book you may be heard from varying headlines before: 

Ron Wayne had several reasons for selling his interest in a side project. It was about to become a full-time endeavour, demanding far more time than he had to give. His day job at gaming company was solid and brought in a reasonable paycheck; leaving that job would represent a certain level of financial risk. And perhaps most significantly, another side project had cost him his investment, leaving him feeling burned. 

His two co-founders had a view of how they wanted to change the world (every entrepreneur constantly talk about that, isn’t it), but it didn’t’ match Ron’s. 12 days after the company was formally founded, he sold his 10% of the company for $800. Later, once the company was gaining traction and had interested funders, he set aside any claims to the future of the company for another $1500. 

Today Ron would be one of the richest men in the world only if he had decided to hold on to any part of his ownership. The company is the most valuable firm on our planet. You may figure out the other two partners were Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The company was Apple.

We are not saying he should have been able to see the future and quit his job, but from his public interviews, it seems once he made up his mind, that was it. He was done with the decision and, when he still had the chance to get back in, he took a small financial incentive just to sever the option.

Let’s ask ourselves a few questions if we were in the positions of Ron (which we never know our start up would be next Apple or not), we still could think about that:

Do we consider how long we would have to incur the financial risk of quitting day job?

Could less exhaustive work hours be negotiated post-launch?

Would our voice and view of the world have enhanced our company further?

Being open to embracing uncertainty while considering potential risk and discomfort could well be essential to achieving your potential. Preparing for a changing future requires that you allow yourself to be open to options you may have rejected in the past or to approaches you find uncomfortable at first.

Things will change if we are open to ideas beyond the obvious and most immediate choices: It is the premise keep you continue to read the rest of this article. 

What is a job? 

Look over a few definitions on the web and it’s easy to see that few of us are still limited to Google’s first meaning: “a paid position of regular employment.”

Let us move past 330 B.C., when Aristotle wrote, “All paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind.” Currently, the definition of a job looks more like the second meaning from Google” “a task or piece of work, especially one that is paid.” Piecing together multiple gigs at the same time or freelancing in a series of work-for-hire roles is a new normal. 

Rarely are jobs assigned or taken on because of a strategic plan to build your skills and capability, thus preparing you for the future of work. Instead, the nature of fluctuating workloads requires moving to meet those needs, whether your skills and motivation match or not. 

Quoted from ‘Stretch’: ‘Jobs are fluid. You need to find where the company has an issue or problem and figure out how you can best solve the problem. If you show how, you can add value, your career will follow.’

Most of us feel our hands are tied when it comes to seeking alternatives to shape our future, we felt being unengaged or actively disengaged. Lots of people just kind of present, but not inspired by their work or their managers. As people live and therefore work longer lives, it becomes necessary to reshape the identities we formed in our careers.
